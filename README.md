Database of quantum circuits encoding computational processes on biological substrates

## To Do
- Develop database of quantum circuits encoding biological processes and computations running on biological substrates
- Develop equivariant neural network models obtimal for classes of circuits with certain symmetries
- Use overfitting for data compression
- Adapt quantum circuits to use modified entanglement as in [cirq_hybrid_codes](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/cirq_hybrid_codes)
