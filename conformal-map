For any finite graph of mixed dimensional hybrid qudits representing a molecule, we can 
spatially separate some of the qudits, partitioning the grapph into subgraphs. This would 
represent a chemical reaction with precursor the original graph, and product molecules given by 
the subgraphs that have been spacially separates. Since each graph in such a chemical
equation can be thought of as a hybrid qudit surface code, and therefore as a dessin d'enfant, 
we can represent this spatial separation as a conformal mapping of some Riemann surface(s) 
to some new set of Riemann surface(s). Using AdS-CFT this can be represented as a set of 
qudit gates operating on the qudits. We would use controlled-U gates for somne unitaries
U in SU(d) specific to and determined by the chemical reaction to modify the entanglement 
between qudits (atoms and molecule). 

Since every chemical reaction can be modelled in this way, this is an optmial place to begin
for this project. Moreover, the general idea can be transferred to nuclear physics and thus 
would be useful for the quark.io project as well.
