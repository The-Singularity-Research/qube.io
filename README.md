Database of quantum circuits encoding computational processes on biological substrates

## To Do
- Develop database of quantum circuits encoding biological processes and computations running on biological substrates
- Develop equivariant neural network models obtimal for classes of circuits with certain symmetries
- Give overfit model as data compression for all circuits

The goal of this repository is to give a compression (for computational efficientcy) of all quantum circuits running on biological substrates, for example, neurolical processes, digestive processes, photosynthetic processes, etc. Once this is accomplished we want to train several machine learning models which are optimized for the symmetries of these processes in order to (1) over fit some of the models for data compression, and (2) have models predict and compose new quantum circuits that can minimize and entropy and harvest neg-entropy (i.e. reverse entropy) in biological processes at the quantum level. We do not wish to simulate quantum processes, we need to run the computations accurately in order to use the time-reversibility or quantum physics to encode circuits into biological substrates that can reverse entropy. We should builld, using surface code and string theoretic circuits to build molecular sized time crystals and circuits that reverse entropy. 

###To-Do:

1. Using arbitrary controlled-U gates in place of controlled-X (CNOT) gates to entangle qubits we get a more complex variety of entangled states. If we also allow the controlled-U gates to be dynamic (learnable parameters in a uantum neural network) we can make entanglement between qudits a dynamic parameter. 

2. This parameter can be interpreted as a form of distance between qudits. Using energy level of qudits as a second parameter and using a dynamic DB-scan with these two parameters gives a way of computing 2-parameter persistent homology. The persistent homology allows us to understand emergent geometric and topological properties of the quantum system. 

3. We can define maps between surface code states that model conformal maps of conformal field theories on some Riemann surface. The idea is to think of the surface code (corresponding to the gentle surface algebra) as a bundle of operators over a Riemann surface. A conformal map of Riemann surfaces with a conformal field theory correspond to a map of bundles, which should be defined by some local qudit gates or a generalized version of qudit gates according to surface algebra theory. 

###Important Circuits:

1. Proton pumps should be considered top priority as a first uantum circuit model. They are ubiquitous in many biological processes.
