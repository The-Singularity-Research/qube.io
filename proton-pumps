Proton pumps are one of the fundamental mechanisms in biophysics that are responsible for many 
physical chemistry processes in biological organisms. They are present in brain chemistry and 
neuroscience and are responsible for digestive and metabolite processes. Proton pumps are 
responsible for the effectiveness of medications such as acid reflux, stomach ulcers, GERD, 
heartburn, and closely related conditions and symptoms.

Proton pumps are responsible for the effects of hydration products with sodium (Na+) and 
potassium ions and can be responsible for headaches associated to dihydrogen monoxide 
levels in the brain and muscle fibres. Circuit mdels of proton pumps are therefore of high 
importance and should be considered early on and updated often as new research informs changes
that should be made.
